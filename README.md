# DataStructure
## Arrays and Strings
1. Arrays(1D) and strings are very similar: they both represent an ordered group of elements.
2. Similarly, strings are implemented differently between languages. In Python and Java, they are immutable. In C++, they are mutable.
   O(n), n is the size of the string if there are string ="a,b,c"
## Linked Lists
### Nodes are an abstract idea. A node can be thought of as an element but with more information than just one piece of data like an integer or string.
